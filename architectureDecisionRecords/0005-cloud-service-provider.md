# Title

Cloud service provider

## Context

We need a place to host the new UCP services and UI.

The current services are hosted on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). We don't see a major difference between AWS or [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/gcp)'s product offerings that would sway us either way, but MX has expertise in GCP.

## Decision

We will use GCP to host our services and UI.

## Consequences

It will take some time to set up a GCP account and host our services on it, but we will be able to leverage MX's DevOps expertise to do it well.
