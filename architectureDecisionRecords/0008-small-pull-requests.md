# Title

Small Pull Requests

## Context

Large pull requests have the following issues:
1. Exhausting and time consuming to review
1. Even more exhausting to re-review
1. Higher likelihood of important things being missed
1. Higher likelihood of suboptimal work being approved
1. Slow feedback cycle. You can follow a suboptimal path for longer before getting feedback. This results in more wasted work.
1. Big merge conflicts


## Decision

We will strive to create small, focused pull requests that fulfill a single purpose.

## Consequences

Code will get merged faster. Code will be of higher quality. Fewer bugs will be introduced. Less time will be wasted on suboptimal paths.
